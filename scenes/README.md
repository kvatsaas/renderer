# Scene Data

This is a repository of scene data used for testing rendering code.  There are different folders with progressingly more complex scenes, either due to object complexity or requiring special features within the rendering code.

## Scene_A

The `scenes_A` folder contains the base level scenes.  You should test your code with these scenes as they represent the basic capabilities that your rendering code will support.
